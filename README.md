# UMass Transfer Portal Dashboard - Shiny App
This is the Dashboard I made when I worked with the UMass Baseball Team. Originally I wanted to scrape the players' data from TruMedia but that didn't work out. It ended up not looking the best but it allowed the coaches to easily look at whatever player they wanted to see without having all the data from the other players in the way. It pulled from the Google Sheet we used to store there data. I put in fake names and data now that it is available to the public. 

This is the Link.
